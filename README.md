# WizardOfRandom

This is a First person adventure game where you have to escape a prison. Playable in browser. Description:

Welcome to the Dark Dungeon, my friend!

Our great Wizard decided to choose you (randomly, of course) for his latest experiment. What for you may seem like a punishment, for him is just another scientific approach for his genius studies. Don’t be afraid. All you have to do is defy the laws of pure luck, defeat the five Random Portals and walk out of the door – if you can.

Good luck! 

Artstyle and architecture are heavily inspired by Ben Williken's Cold Rooms. Submission fro the 9th Klagenfurt game jam.
